# PRIMIREPO
Hi everyone, here i´m going to desmostrate how i did my first programmation code something that took a lot of time because i´m new in those topics but here i am.

Firstable we have to install all the programms that we need

•Python interpreter 

•Visual Studio Code with the extensions that we think that are useful for us.

•Git

After that, we have to review if the python interpreter is running, to do it we have to run the windows console (windows + r and then write cmd + enter) and we can see the terminal. Being here we wrote the command:  " python " and we have to see someting like this:

Now we have to execute the following code:

On those programms:

• Windows NotePad and run it on the terminal

• The Python Interpreter

• Visual Studio Code

Now let's start executing the code on the different programms:

First, the Windows Notepad, so we have to write the code

And save it on the desk as a .py file, in my case i kept it as "Holamundo.py" (it´s so important to take into account the folder in which we saved our code)

After that we have to open our code on Git Bash, and for that we click outside the icons and click on "Git Bash Here"

Once we are on the Git controller we have to verify our code by typing:

Python + the document´s name within ".py" at the end and it should look like this:

And as we can see the code was executed correctly

Now, we can run the code on the Windows terminal, for this step we have to have open the Windows console and execute the python interpreter as i explained at the beginning and we have to search the folder in which we kept our code typing cd + the folder's name + enter and after that type python + space + the document's name including the ".py" + enter. And after that we can see the code executed on the Windows terminal, it sould look like this:

And finally, let's executed the code on the Visual Studio Code, and for this step we only have to open the Visual Studio Code and open the file directly from the programm, after that we can see the code on the Visual Studio and how it runs here. It should look like this:

And that's all, it's something really easy but can take a bit of time because can look as something difficult if you are new programming, but do not give up!
